# Overriding-Method-Java

I follow allong a YouTube video to understand Overriding method.
Overriding method is when the subclass use the same method from the parent class
but uses its own implementation. 

How?
Create two class: Animal(superclass) and Dog(subclass).
The Animal has the original method for speak.
The Dog extends from Animal and has the same method speak.
However, it implements a different message. 
This can be done by using the keyword @Override.
